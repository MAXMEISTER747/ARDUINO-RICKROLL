# RICK-ROLLDUINO
Rickroll people by plugging your arduino into their computer

To use this, simply download and put in your arduino projects folder, then open the arduino IDE and open the folder and file that you want. Click upload and unplug the arduino. Now go rickroll some people.

# Windows CMD
Uses the Win+R run menu then opens the link

# Chromebook
Opens the search menu and goes to the link
Can be used for windows if when you type a link in the start menu, it goes to it

# Browser (wlc-browser)
Works with Linux, Chromebook and Windows
Requires a browser to be in focus
Opens new tab, pastes link, presses enter

# Mac
Works like the browser but opens tab with the CMD key (so it works with mac)

# *New* Mac CMD
Opens terminal via spotlight and uses the open command to open the link in the defauld browser
Doesn't work if terminal is already open
This is a bit of a luck of the draw particually if you have to use an adapter for the newer crapbooks

# Windows CMD (Autoplay protection)
Just like Win CMD but presses space after opening link for if people have autoplay turned which is default on some browsers (firefox, for example)
